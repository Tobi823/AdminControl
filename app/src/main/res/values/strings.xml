    <string name="pref_wipe_after_too_many_incorrect_device_unlock_passwords_attempts_summary">Enables a built-in policy that will perform a device or profile wipe after 10 incorrect device-unlock passwords (or PINs, patterns) have been entered. Android usually displays a warning, if you have 4 or less unlock tries left. On my Nexus 7 2013 (LineageOS 14.1, custom recovery TWRP) I had to disable \"Secure start-up\" for TWRP to be able to delete my data. With \"Secure start-up\" TWRP prompted me for my password before wiping my data (=> I was able to abort wiping).</string>

    <string name="dialog_explain_permissions">This app needs Device Administrator permissions in order to disable the use of the fingerprint on the lockscreen and for wiping the device after too many incorrect device-unlock password. Nothing else is done with this permission. Sadly I don\'t know how to request only the necessary permissions for the current selected options - that why I request all three Device Administrator permissions at one. This app has NO network access so it is impossible to control it remotely.</string>
