        after too many incorrect device-unlock password. Nothing else is done with this permission.
        Sadly I don\'t know how to request only the necessary permissions for the current selected
        options (e.g. only disable-keyguard-features for \"Disable Fingerprint…\"
        and only watch-login/wipe-data for \"Wipe device…\" - that why I request all three Device
        Administrator permissions at one. This app has NO network access so it is impossible to
        control it remotely.</string>
