    <string name="pref_wipe_after_too_many_incorrect_device_unlock_passwords_attempts_summary">Enables a built-in policy that will perform a device or profile wipe after too many incorrect device-unlock passwords (or PINs, patterns) have been entered. Android usually displays a warning, if you have 4 or less unlock tries left. But when the bootloader of the device is unlocked, either the wipe does not work (because the TWRP recovery will asks for your password before wiping) or an attacker can use the TWRP recovery to access your data without entering any passwords.</string>

    <string name="dialog_explain_permissions">This app needs Device Administrator permissions in order to disable the use of the fingerprint on the lockscreen and for wiping the device after too many incorrect device-unlock password. Nothing else is done with this permission. Sadly I don\'t know how to request only the necessary permissions for the current selected options - that why I request all three Device Administrator permissions at one. This app has NO network access so it is impossible to control it remotely.</string>

    <string name="dialog_explain_device_owner_permission">The app needs the \'device owner\' permission for restarting the smartphone after too many login tries. First the app tries to get the permission by executing a root command.
